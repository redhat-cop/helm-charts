# ðŸ‘» Helper for Sealed Secrets 

This chart is NOT the chart to deploy [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets). This a collection of reusable templates to avoid code repetition in other charts. To use this chart add it as a dependency and supply the correct values you'd like to include. There are no default sensible values only examples of how to use this chart.

You must supply an already sealed secret to this chart. This chart will not execute the commands to seal the secret for you. for instructions on Sealing Secrets, take a look at the [instructions here](https://github.com/rht-labs/ubiquitous-journey/blob/master/docs/sealed-secrets.md)
