  ## Description

  Loki requires a secret with specific keys. This Chart creates a Job that will create such a secret based on the OpenShift Data Foundation BucketClaim.

This Helm Chart is required when LokiStack requires a Secret object with specific keys.
The bucket in our case is created by OpenShift Data Foundation. ODF will create a Secret and a ConfigMap using the name of the Bucket. The Chart will then create a Job, that mounts the Secret and Configmap and creates a new Secret with the required keys for Loki.

The keys are:

1. access_key_id
2. access_key_secret
3. bucketnames
4. endpoint
5. region
