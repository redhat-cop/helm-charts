# `false` to create  manual InstallPlan approval resources as part of normal install
#
# The hook method is nice to not have lingering resources needed for the manual InstallPlan approval but has the downside
# that no CustomResources using CustomResourceDefinitions installed by the operator can be used in the same chart because
# the operator InstallPlan wont be approved, and therefor the operator wont be installed, until the post-install,post-upgrade phase
# which means you will never get to that phase because your CustomResources wont be able to apply because the Operator isn't installed.
# This is is ultimately a trade off between cleaning up these resources or being able to install and configure the operator in the same
# helm chart that has a dependency on this helm chart.

# If specified, this imagePullSecret will be used for pulling the `installPlanApproverAndVerifyJobsImage`.

# from the given `pythonIndexURL` and `pythonExtraIndexURL` into the `installPlanApproverAndVerifyJobsImage` at run time
#
# This is because the supported ose-cli image from red hat does not include the Python libraries
# and it is beyond the scope of this helm chart to provide an image that provides those tools.
#
# If `false`, such as if you are running in a disconnected environment, you either need to change `installPlanApproverAndVerifyJobsImage` to be an image that includes `oc` and the required python libraires.
# Or change `pythonIndexURL` and `pythonExtraIndexURL` to be a local python index with the required python libraries.

# Required Python libraries

#   * semver==2.13.0
