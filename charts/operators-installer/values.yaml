# `true` to create (and clean up) manual InstallPlan approval resources as part of post-install,post-upgrade helm hook
# `false` to create  manual InstallPlan approval resources as part of normal install
#
# The hook method is nice to not have lingering resources needed for the manual InstallPlan approval but has the downside
# that no CustomResources using CustomResourceDefinitions installed by the operator can be used in the same chart because
# the operator InstallPlan wont be approved, and therefor the operator wont be installed, until the post-install,post-upgrade phase
# which means you will never get to that phase because your CustomResources wont be able to apply because the Operator isn't installed.
# This is is ultimately a trade off between cleaning up these resources or being able to install and configure the operator in the same
# helm chart that has a dependency on this helm chart.
