## Purpose

There is no native way to declaratively control the version of installed operators. If you set to Automatic, then operators will auto upgrade, breaking declarative, if set to Manual then human has to go manually approve. This helm chart allows for setting to Manual but having the helm chart automatically approve the correct InstallPlan for the specific version, so as not to accidentally approve a newer InstallPlan.

| operators[].namespace                        | `.Release.Namespace` | No | Specify the namespace to install the operator into, which allows different operators to be installed into different namespaces from the same chart. If

## Warnings

### Can not install / upgrade different operators in same namespace independently

As documented in [How can Operators be updated independently from each other?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6389681) when more then one operator install or update is pending in the same namespace the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) will combine those installs/updates into a single InstallPlan and there is no way to separate them. Therefor if you use this helm chart in namespace ZZZ to install operator A at v1.0 and it has a pending update to v1.1 and then update the configuration to also install operator B at v42.0 in namespace ZZZ the ZZZ v42.0 InstallPlan and the A v1.1 InstallPlan will get merged (by OLM) and this helm chart will then approve that InstallPlan as it will match on the ZZZ v42.0 pending install, which will incidentally install the A v1.1 update.

There is no way for this or any helm chart, automation, or even click ops to prevent this, as documented in [How can Operators be updated independently from each other?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6389681) this is currently considered "a feature of OLM".

Therefor if you do not want this unintentional behavior, which these helm chart righters assume you don't since you are going to the trouble of declaratively controlling your operator versions, your only current option is to only have one operator installed per namespace, which primarily means don't use the `openshift-operators` namespace, or if you do, only use it for one operator, maybe OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD).


### ArgoCD / Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Sync Status and Health Checks
If using this helm chart with ArgoCD / Red Hat OpenShift GitOps then you will need to patch how ArgoCD does health checks on Subscriptions by default
because the default health check will fail if there is any pending installations which is a problem for two reasons. First the approval is a post hook
(which technically it could be made an install hook, if not for reason two), secondly if installing an older version fo an operator the Subscription will
report there is a pending update, even though you don't wan't to update, and ArgoCD will constantly say the Subscription is pending.

Here is a sample updated health check to use which if the InstallPlan is set to Manual then will ignore pending plan approvals with a detailed message. How you patch ArgoCD with this health check depends on your version of ArgoCD so see the docs for your version.

```lua
health_status = {}
if obj.status ~= nil then
    if obj.status.conditions ~= nil then
        numDegraded = 0
        numPending = 0
        msg = ""
        for i, condition in pairs(obj.status.conditions) do
            msg = msg .. i .. ": " .. condition.type .. " | " .. condition.status .. "\n"
            if condition.type == "InstallPlanPending" and condition.status == "True" then
                numPending = numPending + 1
            elseif (condition.type == "InstallPlanMissing" and condition.reason ~= "ReferencedInstallPlanNotFound") then
                numDegraded = numDegraded + 1
            elseif (condition.type == "CatalogSourcesUnhealthy" or condition.type == "InstallPlanFailed" or condition.type == "ResolutionFailed") and condition.status == "True" then
                numDegraded = numDegraded + 1
            end
        end
    end
    if numDegraded == 0 and numPending == 0 then
        health_status.status = "Healthy"
        health_status.message = msg
        return health_status
    elseif numPending > 0 and numDegraded == 0 and obj.spec.installPlanApproval == "Manual" then
        health_status.status = "Healthy"
        health_status.message = "An install plan for a subscription is pending installation but install plan approval is set to manual so considering this as healthy: " .. msg
        return health_status
    elseif numPending > 0 and numDegraded == 0 then
        health_status.status = "Progressing"
        health_status.message = "An install plan for a subscription is pending installation"
        return health_status
    else
        health_status.status = "Degraded"
        health_status.message = msg
        return health_status
    end
end
return health_status
```

## Caveats

### Rollbacks

This helm chart can not currently role operator versions back. PRs welcome.
